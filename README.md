# Cryptocurrencies
`Using unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data.`

## Resources
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.7.11
- Data: crypto_data.csv

## Overview of Project

This project has revolved around gaining experience and understanding of unsupervised machine learning models. There are many times where the sought after output for a dataset is either unknown or untold, and so it is prudent to understand unsupervised algorithms. Therefore, I have become aquainted with the K-means algorithm, which has allowed me to group similar data into clusters. However, to expedite this process, I have also learned the details of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). With these skills under my belt, I am tasked with creating a report regarding what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could and should be grouped together in clusters. I will use the aforementioned unsupervised techniques to make sense of the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. 

## Results

This assignments consists of completion of the following 4 Deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

## Summary

As previously stated, I had no clear idea as to output, upon receiving this assignment. Consequently, I utilized unsupervised machine learning to find patterns or clusters, in the data. Through this assignment, I was able to gain some insight into the world of cryptocurrency. There are a vast amount of cryptocurrencies, but through this analysis, they were put into four classes. Out of these classes, it would appear that Bitcoin and Turtlecoin are the most lucrative and promising cryptocurrencies. Further analysis would be needed to give any advice about investing into these cryptocurrencies, but it is clear that unsupervised learning can allow for promising discoveries in the world of cryptocurrency and beyond.
